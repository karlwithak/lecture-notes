# Interactive Animal Identification Tool (IAIT)

This tool will help users identify animals by asking a series of questions and then provide a list of most likely animals based on the user's responses. This tool will be used by wildlife conservationists to identify animals they encounter.

## User Flow:

1. Users answer a series of questions about the observed animal.
2. Based on user inputs, the system will analyze potential matches.
3. The system will display a list of animals that most closely match the user's responses.

Note: A different team will build the system to perform the analysis in step 2.

In the future we may add more animal species, and including photos or sounds in the identification process.
