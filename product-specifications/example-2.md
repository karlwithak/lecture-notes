# Interactive Animal Identification Tool (IAIT)

This tool will help users identify animals by asking a series of questions and then provide a list of most likely animals based on the user's responses. This tool will be used by wildlife conservationists to identify animals they encounter.

## User Flow

1. Users answer a series of questions about the observed animal:
    - What color is the animal?
    - Where was the animal observed?
    - How large was the animal?
3. Based on user inputs, the system will analyze potential matches.
4. The system will display a list of animals that most closely match the user's responses.

## Animals Included
- Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) 🦅
- Tiger (Panthera tigris) 🐅
- Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) 🦒
- Hippo (Hippopotamus amphibius) 🦛
- Cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) 🐍

In the future we may add more animal species, and including photos or sounds in the identification process.
